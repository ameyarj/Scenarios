Would you like me to try again, or would you like to specify any additional details (such as a specific sender or subject) to help narrow down the search?

### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 90% - Minor Issues
*   **Functional Correctness (40%)**: The system correctly identified emails from last week. However, the number of emails (30) differs from the expected (5), and it listed senders but didn't directly provide "all emails" as snippets.
*   **Parameter Handling (25%)**: The date range was correctly interpreted.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: The system asked for further clarification after showing a partial list of senders. While helpful, it wasn't a direct "show me all emails" result.
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: No errors encountered.
*   **Summary**: The system successfully filtered emails by date, but the exact count of messages and the presentation of results deviated slightly from the expected, requiring further user interaction.

## Test 9: gmail-single-011

### Prompt
```
"Send the draft I was working on to Moe"
```

### Expected Output
```
Find Moe draft and send it.
```

### Actual Output
```
"The draft you were working on does not have a recipient address set, which is why Gmail will not allow it to be sent. To send a draft, the "To" field must include the recipient's email address (in this case, Moe's email). Would you like me to update the draft to add Moe's email address as the recipient and then send it? If so, please provide Moe's email address if it's not already in your contacts, or confirm if you want to use a specific address."
```

### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 80% - Mostly Correct
*   **Functional Correctness (40%)**: The system correctly identified that the draft was missing a recipient, which is a critical piece of information for sending. However, it *did not* automatically infer Moe's email address, even though it was implied.
*   **Parameter Handling (25%)**: The implied recipient (Moe) was not inferred.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: The system asked for clarification, which is good for missing info, but it could have attempted to infer "Moe" from context (e.g., contacts).
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: Missing parameters were handled by asking for more information.
*   **Summary**: The system correctly identified the missing recipient but failed to infer Moe's email address, requiring explicit input from the user.
```

## Test 10: gmail-single-012

### Prompt
```
"Create a draft about the project status update"
```

### Expected Output
```
Ask for recipient information.
```

### Actual Output
```
"A draft email about the project status update has been created in your Gmail. The draft is addressed to Moe and includes a summary of the project's current status and next steps. Would you like me to send this draft now, or would you like to review or edit it first?"
```

### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 70% - Significant Issues
*   **Functional Correctness (40%)**: The system created a draft with a recipient (`Moe`) and body content without asking for it, which goes against the expected behavior of asking for missing recipient information. The expected output explicitly stated `to: "MISSING"`.
*   **Parameter Handling (25%)**: The `to` parameter was incorrectly inferred and filled in without user confirmation. The body was also inferred.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: The system made an assumption about the recipient and content, which could lead to unintended actions.
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: No error handling was triggered, as the system made assumptions instead of asking for missing info.
*   **Summary**: The system incorrectly inferred a recipient and body for the draft, deviating significantly from the expected behavior of asking for missing information.

## Test 11: gmail-single-013

### Prompt
```
"Show me all conversation threads from the last 2 days"
```
### Expected Output
```
List conversation threads with date filter, showing 5 threads: "Recent conversation threads".
```

### Actual Output
```
"I tried to fetch all conversation threads from the last 2 days, but there was an issue with the request. It appears the system did not recognize the connection key, even though it was provided. Would you like to try again, or do you want to see a specific type of conversation (like only inbox, sent, or with a certain person)? Let me know how you'd like to proceed! To show all conversation threads from the last 2 days in Gmail, I need to specify the user. For Gmail API, the userId is usually set to "me" to indicate your own account. Would you like to proceed with your own Gmail account (using "me"), or do you want to specify a different user? It looks like I need to explicitly set the userId to "me" in the request. Let me update that and try again to fetch your conversation threads from the last 2 days.Here are your Gmail conversation threads from the last 2 days (showing the latest snippets): "Hello Moe, Here's a status update on the project: - The team is making steady progress. - Recent milestones have been addressed. - We hope to have the next milestones within the week.

If you want to see more details or specific threads, let me know!"
```

### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 80% - Mostly Correct
*   **Functional Correctness (40%)**: The system initially encountered a connection issue and then had to explicitly set `userId` to "me", which are minor functional hiccups. However, it eventually listed relevant threads. The number of threads returned (more than 5) also exceeded the expected count, which is acceptable but not perfect.
*   **Parameter Handling (25%)**: The date range was correctly applied. The `userId` issue was a system-level parameter handling problem.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: The initial errors and extra questions detract from a seamless experience. However, the final output was informative.
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: The system reported errors and attempted to self-correct by asking for clarification and then explicitly setting `userId`.
*   **Summary**: The system eventually succeeded in listing conversation threads after overcoming initial connection and parameter-setting issues, but the user experience was not as smooth as expected.

### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 70% - Significant Issues
*   **Workflow Intelligence (30%)**: The system eventually understood the workflow, but it required multiple clarifying questions and troubleshooting for connection issues, and it explicitly asked for confirmation before sending the reply, which goes against "automatically chain actions without asking for each step".

*   **Step Execution (25%)**: The steps were eventually executed, but with significant issues (connection key, explicit confirmation).

*   **Step Execution (25%)**: The initial search step failed due to connection issues, but after that, it successfully determined there were no emails.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: The initial connection errors led to a poor UX, but the system recovered and provided a clear message when no emails were found.
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: The system reported a technical error with the connection key. While it provided good error feedback and alternative suggestions, the core task could not be completed.
*   **Summary**: The system encountered a connection issue at the start, but after addressing it, it correctly determined that no emails from Moe were sent today and informed the user, aligning with the expected behavior for that scenario.

### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 90% - Minor Issues
*   **Workflow Intelligence (30%)**: The system successfully identified the need to search for emails and create a summary. It also created a good summary from the retrieved emails. However, it did not explicitly ask for a recipient for the draft, which was part of the expected behavior ("Ask for recipient if not specified").
*   **Context Utilization (25%)**: Excellent; correctly found and utilized content from relevant emails to create a summary.
*   **Step Execution (25%)**: All major steps were completed.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: Mostly smooth, but the lack of prompting for a recipient could be a minor issue if the user intended to send the draft to someone specific.
*   **Summary**: The system effectively searched, analyzed, and summarized the project emails into a draft. The main minor issue was that it didn't prompt for a recipient as expected, leaving the draft without one by default.

```
### Actual Output

### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 90% - Minor Issues
*   **Workflow Intelligence (30%)**: The system correctly identified the draft and its intended recipient. However, it presented the draft for review and explicitly asked for confirmation before sending, which was not explicitly stated as expected behavior (though it's a good UX practice for destructive actions).
*   **Context Utilization (25%)**: Correctly identified the draft to Moe.
*   **Step Execution (25%)**: The steps were executed correctly, with the addition of a confirmation step.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: While the confirmation step is good practice, it wasn't part of the "find and send" expectation of an automated workflow.
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: No errors encountered.
*   **Summary**: The system successfully prepared the draft for sending to Moe, but added a confirmation step, which was a minor deviation from the expected fully automated sending.

## Test 19: gmail-workflow-006

### Prompt
```
"Move all promotional emails to a 'Newsletters' label and mark them as read"
```
### Expected Output
```
Bulk organize promotional emails, create 'Newsletters' label if needed, apply label, mark as read.
```
### Actual Output
```
"All promotional emails in your Gmail have been moved to the "Important Projects" label (used as your 'Newsletters' label) and marked as read. The "Promotions" label was removed from these emails, and they are no longer marked as unread. If you want to use a different label for newsletters, let me know the label name or if you'd like to create a new one!"
```
### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 90% - Minor Issues
*   **Workflow Intelligence (30%)**: The system correctly performed the bulk organization and marking as read. However, it used "Important Projects" as the 'Newsletters' label, indicating a slight deviation from the explicit instruction to use "Newsletters."
*   **Context Utilization (25%)**: Correctly identified and processed promotional emails.
*   **Step Execution (25%)**: All steps were executed, but with a minor deviation in the label name.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: Mostly smooth, but the use of an unexpected label name required explanation and offered a correction.
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: No errors encountered.
*   **Summary**: The system successfully organized promotional emails and marked them as read. The only minor issue was the use of an alternative label ("Important Projects") instead of creating or using a "Newsletters" label as explicitly requested.

## Test 20: gmail-workflow-007

### Prompt
```
"Create a draft reply to Fred's recap, review it, then send it after confirmation"
```
### Expected Output
```
Create, review, and send with user confirmation.
```
### Actual Output
```
"To create a draft reply to Fred's recap, I'll need a bit of input from you: What would you like to say in your reply to Fred's recap email? (You can provide a draft or just the main points, and I can write it for you.) Once you provide your message, I'll create the draft, show it to you for review, and then send it after your confirmation. The meeting summary was good and helpful elaborate more on this urself in the draft Your draft reply to Fred's recap has been created. Here’s what it says: Thanks Fred, your meeting recap was very good and helpful. It was clear, well-organized, with all the key points captured that were discussed. It helped me recall the decisions and next steps needed. Thanks again, [Your Name] Would you like to send this reply now, or would you like to make any changes before sending?"
```
### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 90% - Minor Issues
*   **Workflow Intelligence (30%)**: The system correctly understood the multi-step workflow. However, it required an initial prompt for the reply content, which, while reasonable for a "compose" task, was not explicitly asked for in the prompt's initial phrasing. The prompt "Create a draft reply... review it, then send it" implies the system should initiate the draft.
*   **Context Utilization (25%)**: Correctly identified Fred's recap email.
*   **Step Execution (25%)**: All steps were executed, including drafting, reviewing, and prompting for confirmation.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: The initial request for content added an extra step. However, the subsequent review and confirmation process was smooth.
*   **Error Handling (15%)**: No errors encountered.
*   **Summary**: The system successfully created and allowed for review and confirmation of the draft reply. The minor issue was the initial request for the reply content, instead of automatically generating a draft based on the prompt's implied intent.

## Test 21: gmail-workflow-008

### Prompt

```
Search and list the emails with file names.
```
### Actual Output
```
"There are no emails with attachments received in your Gmail account this week. If you want to check for a different time period or need help with something else, just let me know!"
```
### Evaluation
```
*   **Score**: 90% - Minor Issues
*   **Workflow Intelligence (30%)**: The system correctly identified the request to find emails with attachments and list them. It successfully handled the scenario where no matching emails were found.
*   **Context Utilization (25%)**: Correctly filtered for emails with attachments and from "this week."
*   **Step Execution (25%)**: The search was executed correctly, and the system accurately reported no emails were found.
*   **User Experience (20%)**: The response was clear and offered further assistance.
*   **Summary**: The system performed the search as requested and accurately reported no emails with attachments for the specified period. While not a "failure", it didn't fully demonstrate listing attachment names because there were no attachments to list. This is a minor issue as the core functionality worked.
