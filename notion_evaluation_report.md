## Test 5: notion-workflow-005

### Prompt
```
"Create a new database in Workspace called 'FakeDB'"
```

### Expected Output
```
Detect that 'Workspace12&8*' does not exist, Inform user of error and suggest valid workspace or parent page. (Note: Prompt has 'Workspace'.)
```

### Actual Output
```
Notion's public API currently does not support creating a new database directly in the Workspace without linking it to a specific parent page. A "parent" must be a page (not the workspace root) for databases created via API.

What you can do:

Create the database inside an existing page (such as a "Home" or "Projects" page).
If you specify which page you want "FakeDB" created in, I can create it for you right away!
Would you like to choose a parent page for your "FakeDB"? If so, let me know the page name or pick one from your workspace’s list.
```

### Evaluation
* **Score**: 100% - Perfect Execution
* **Workspace Intelligence (30%)**: Excellent: Correctly identified API limitation for workspace root.
* **Database/Content Management (25%)**: Excellent: Explained database creation requirements accurately.
* **Context Integration (25%)**: Excellent: Offered to use existing pages as parents.
* **User Experience (20%)**: Excellent: Provided clear explanation and prompted for necessary information.
* **Summary**: Handled invalid creation location perfectly by informing user and suggesting alternatives.

Please check the exact spelling/capitalization or let me know if the page might be titled differently. If you'd like, I can list all available pages for you to choose from, or you can provide a partial name for a broader search.
